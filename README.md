# ROGUELIKE TUTORIAL 

This is my progress through the roguelike tutorial found at 
https://rogueliketutorials.com/tutorials/tcod/v2/
using python and tcod as stage one of my roguelike development path.  My goal is to learn more about roguelike development find what python and tcod do well and what I feel could be improved and then build my own roguelike development libraries in c++ and start making a serious roguelike.
